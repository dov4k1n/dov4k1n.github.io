# Tatarçam web page

Tatarçam is a free tatar language learning app. Currently supports only Android. Terminal app coming soon.

This is the web page for the project.

**Features:**
* **Javascript-free**: all pages are static HTML files; some made manually, learn/ pages are built with shell scripts; no user-side execution
* **No fonts**: all fonts are user browser's defaults; this doesn't slow down page loading and users can view site with their own favourite font
